Udacity Project 1 
As described in the project brief, this is a project aimed at applying basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing data in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.

The project demonstrates the following:
1. data exploration to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset.
2. split the data into testing and training sets
3. determine a suitable performance for this problem
4. analyse performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters (ie varying complexity) and training set sizes to assist with the selection of the optimal model.
5. test optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted prices with the data statistics derived in (1).

Learning outcomes:
1. Understanding and use of the Numpy and Scikit-Learn modules in Python.  Specifically:
  i. how to use Numpy to investigate the features of a dataset
  ii. how to analyse performance plots for variance and bias
  iii. how to determine the best guess model to use to make predictions on unseen data
  iv. how to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

The data set was provided by Udacity.
